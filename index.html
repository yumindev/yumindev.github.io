    <p class="my-name">Yumin Gui</p>
    <p>
      I am a software engnieer, and I focus on the front-end. I am also
      a big fan of compilers. And I hope I can build one by myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have two major github accounts, which are
      <a href="https://github.com/medmin" target="_blank">medmin</a> and
      <a href="https://github.com/yumindev" target="_blank">yumindev</a>. Here
      is my <a href="https://blog.yumindev.com" target="_blank">blog</a>. You
      can find me on
      <a href="https://twitter.com/yumindev" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, too.
      If you can read Chinese, I have another
      <a href="https://twitter.com/guiyumin" target="_blank">Twitter</a>
      account.

      I admire
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds" target="_blank"
        >this guy</a
      >. Apparently, I love his quote,
      <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/8/25/132" target="_blank"
        >"Talk is cheap. Show me the code. "</a
      >. That's the principle that guides my self-learning journey. No, I don't
      have a CS degree, but I never stop learning.

    <p>
      Currently, I live in a small town near San Diego, very beautiful, but far
      away from Monica and her friends, or Mr. Reese and Mr. Finch.
    </p>
    <p>Besides coding, I love hiking and tea.</p>
