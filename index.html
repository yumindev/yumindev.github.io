  <h1>Hello.</h1>
  <p class="ym-name">
    My name is Yumin Gui.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a software engineer who focuses on developing client side applications. Also, I am a big fan of compilers.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have two major github accounts, which are <a href="https://github.com/medmin" target="_blank">medmin</a> and <a href="https://github.com/yumindev" target="_blank">yumindev</a>.
    You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/yumindev" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, too.
  </p>
  <p>
    My idol is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds" target="_blank">this guy</a>. Apparently, I love his quote,
    <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/8/25/132" target="_blank">"Talk is cheap. Show me the code."</a>. I love it so so much that, as long as I am awake, I code every hour and every day.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, I live in a small town near San Diego, very beautiful, but far away from Monica and her friends, or John and Harold.
  </p>
  <p>
    Besides coding, I love hiking and tea.
